# Spaces

This is a document listing spaces that might be willing to host a learning group. We can help you reach out to them! Links with `*` next to them are ones that are currently or have previously collaborated with Learning Gardens. 

As a caveat: not all are welcoming to out-of-the-blue requests for use. We recommend being courteous and you might well have to pay. 

We also recommend scrolling through [this list of “Community Labs”](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/community-labs), and reaching out to local libraries, makerspaces, and public art spaces. Sometimes, even meeting in your living room can work!

If your group is purely virtual, we recommend exploring ways to create a digital “space” for your learners to interact together. This can take many forms:
- Google Doc
- Google Hangout
- Skype
- [Flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com/)
- [Figma](http://figma.com)
- and more!
