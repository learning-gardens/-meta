# Spaces

This is a document listing spaces that might be willing to host a learning group. We can help you reach out to them! Links with `*` next to them are ones that are currently or have previously collaborated with Learning Gardens. 

## Some Advice

Not all are welcoming to out-of-the-blue requests for use. We recommend being courteous and you might well have to pay. 

We recommend reaching out to local libraries, makerspaces, and public art spaces. Also, scrol through [this list of “Community Labs”](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/community-labs) from around the world. Sometimes, even meeting in your living room can work. 

When making a space, take inclusion into account. Don’t meet at a bar unless everyone wants to drink. Don’t meet at a coffee shop unless everyone wants to spend money. Consider how people will be arranged in the space to help them feel comfortable and able. 

If your group is purely virtual, we recommend exploring ways to create a digital “space” for your learners to interact together. This can take many forms:
- Google Doc
- Google Hangout
- Skype
- [Flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com/)
- [Figma](http://figma.com)
- and more!
