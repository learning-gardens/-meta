## What is Learning Gardens?

“Étudiants sans Frontières”

_Learning Gardens is a meta-organization to support non-institutional learning, exploration, and community-building._ 

At its simplest it is advice on how to start a reading group. At its most complex, you and your friends can achieve nirvana. 

Outside of college, there’s often a void of focused study. Peer-oriented, interest-driven study and action is better than coursework anyway. Learning Gardens seeks to support new learning endeavors, help support their ongoing structure, and share it all—decentralized, any-subject, communal study or work efforts. 

__What We Can Provide__
- Advice on how to start and structure a learning group.
- An open Slack and Github Site for you to host conversations and notes/resources.
- A community of people interested in discussing learning and organizing. 

## Some Key Values

We hold some values key to how we’ve oriented the project. 

- __Decentralized__
	- Our only home is the internet. We’d love if you can include people remotely. We all are in charge. A mutual network of trust goes a long way. 
- __Agency__
	- We seek to empower people to make their own groups and learning experiences outside of official institutions. The nexus of control is in you. 
- __Open & Low-Barrier__
	- Learning doesn’t work well when people feel they can’t participate. People with high and low levels of skill in an area can learn from each other. 
- __Transparent__
	- Obscurity breeds elitism and insularity. We think making our intentions and actions clear, we can have a better conversation about what everyone wants and how to facilitate it. 
- __Casual Atmosphere, Serious Thought__
	- We hope this is fun, but you also really get something out of it. 
- __Peer-to-peer__
	- Learn from each other. The teacher and student both learn, and it helps deflect large hierarchies. 
- __Multi- and Trans-disciplinary__
	- The world of the 21st century has largely outgrown a set of disciplines that were defined in late 19th century Germany. Let’s not restrict ourselves by those.

## What to do?

~~Recommended: clone the [template class](https://github.com/learning-gardens/_template-class_) as an example of some structure we expect to see in each course repository.~~

(perhaps here… look at some examples, give some possible framing devices or ideas)

## Some Guidelines & Tips

Speculative classes, or those that have not yet been implemented, should have repo names beginning with an underscore, e.g. `_speculative-class`. Meta-level repos (or “stickies” of sorts) will begin with two, e.g. `__meta`.

Exact use of the repository, and creation of sub-directories and additional documents, can depend on the class—you should not feel restricted by any of these suggestions! For legibility, we recommend using __README.md__ for class overview and syllabus, please!

## Story

We are [Édouard](http://edouard.us/) and [Lukas](http://ltwp.net), and we thought this was a good idea in early 2016. The rest is you.
