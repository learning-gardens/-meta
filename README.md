## What is Learning Gardens?

Learning Gardens is a platform to support learning, exploration, and community-building.

At its simplest it is advice on how to start a reading group. At its most complex, you and your friends can achieve nirvana. 

~~Sunday School is an architecture and community for study groups. ~~

~~Book groups are ubiquitous, but what if they focused on more than reading fiction? What if anyone could participate? What if all the meeting notes were online? What if any group could tune into a group elsewhere?~~

When people finish college, there’s often a void of focused study. Peer-oriented, interest-driven study and action is better than coursework anyway. Learning Gardens seeks to help support and share decentralized, any-subject, communal study or work efforts. 

Learning Gardens aims to make it easier to start and facilitate these activities. 

## Some Key Values

We hold some values key to how we’ve oriented the project. 

- __Decentralized__
	- Our only home is the internet. We’d love if you can include people remotely. We all are in charge. A mutual network of trust goes a long way. 
- __Open & Low-Barrier__
	- Learning doesn’t work well when people feel they can’t participate. People with high and low levels of skill in an area can learn from each other. 
- __Transparent__
	- Obscurity breeds elitism and insularity. We think making our intentions and actions clear, we can have a better conversation about what everyone wants and how to facilitate it. 
- __Casual Atmosphere, Serious Thought__
	- We hope this is fun, but you also really get something out of it. 
- __Peer-to-peer__
	- Learn from each other. The teacher and student both learn, and it helps deflect large hierarchies. 
- __Multi- and Trans-disciplinary__
	- The world of the 21st century has largely outgrown a set of disciplines that were defined in late 19th century Germany. Let’s not restrict ourselves by those. 

## What to do?

~~Recommended: clone the [template class](https://github.com/sunday-school/_template-class_) as an example of some structure we expect to see in each course repository. ~~

(perhaps here… look at some examples, give some possible framing devices or ideas)

## Some Guidelines & Tips

Speculative classes, or those that have not yet been implemented, should have repo names beginning with an underscore, e.g. `_speculative-class`. Meta-level repos (or “stickies” of sorts) will begin with two, e.g. `__meta`.

Exact use of the repository, and creation of sub-directories and additional documents, can depend on the class—you should not feel restricted by any of these suggestions! For legibility, we recommend using __README.md__ for class overview and syllabus, please!

## Story

We are [Édouard](http://edouard.us/) and [Lukas](http://ltwp.net), and we thought this was a good idea in early 2016. The rest is you.
