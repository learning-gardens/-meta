## What is Sunday School?

Sunday School is an architecture for a distributed, public, generalized reading group. 

Reading groups are ubiquitous, but what if they focused on more than groups reading fiction? What if anyone could participate? What if all the meeting notes were online? What if any group could tune into a group elsewhere?

## Some Key Values
- decentralized
- open
- transparent
- casual atmosphere, serious topics
- peer-led
- transdisciplinary

## Making Courses

Recommended: clone the [template class](https://github.com/sunday-school/_template-class_) as an example of some structure we expect to see in each course repository. 

Speculative classes, or those that have not yet been implemented, should have repo names surrounded by underscores, e.g. `_speculative-class_`. 

Exact use of the repository, and creation of sub-directories and additional documents, can depend on the classâ€”you should not feel restricted by any of these suggestions!
