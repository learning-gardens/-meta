## What is Sunday School?

Sunday School is an architecture and community for study groups. 

Book groups are ubiquitous, but what if they focused on more than reading fiction? What if anyone could participate? What if all the meeting notes were online? What if any group could tune into a group elsewhere?

When people finish college, there’s often a void of formalized study. Peer-focused, interest-driven study is better anyway. Sunday school seeks to help support and share decentralized, any-subject, group-study efforts. 

Want to learn something? Collect some friends & develop a course together. 

## Some Key Values
- decentralized
- open & low-barrier
- transparent
- casual atmosphere, serious thought
- peer-to-peer learning
- transdisciplinary

## Making Courses

Recommended: clone the [template class](https://github.com/sunday-school/_template-class_) as an example of some structure we expect to see in each course repository. 

Speculative classes, or those that have not yet been implemented, should have repo names surrounded by underscores, e.g. `_speculative-class_`. 

Exact use of the repository, and creation of sub-directories and additional documents, can depend on the class—you should not feel restricted by any of these suggestions! We do really recommend at least writing the __README.md__ and some ordering of content in the __syllabus.md__. 

## Branding

We like these colors:
`#B39E98,#B39E98,#80716C,#B39E98,#000000,#EB4D5C`

## Story

We are [Édouard](http://edouard.us/) and [Lukas](http://ltwp.net), and we thought this was a good idea in early 2016. The rest is you.
