## What Can My Group Do?

Whatever you want. We recommend looking at our [examples](https://github.com/learning-gardens/__meta/blob/master/examples.md) document to help get a sense of the universe of ways you can organize a learning group!

Want to work on your illustration? Dedicate some group time to it, maybe include critiques. 

Want to read a difficult book? Find a couple partners and tackle it, maybe with some reading guides and external conversations. 

Want to learn how to garden? Find some friends who do, too, and get in touch with local sources. 

Want to get a landscape of postcolonial theory? As usual, find some friends, figure out a method of approach, and get some weekly meet-ups going! 

## How Should We Structure Our Group?

We don‚Äôt intend to tell you exactly how to do your group. Every one can (and probably should) be different, responding to the people, the context, the material, and other factors. 

But, we can make some large claims for effective learning! We espouse:

- Multimodal learning (don‚Äôt just read; read, talk, look, experiment, play, touch, listen, smell, etc). Field trips are great, even if just an excuse to go somewhere with people. 
- Regularity. Without regularity groups can easily lose momentum or focus. We recommend seeking a regular time and place if possible, and meeting at least once a month.
- Manage group size. Most conversations happen best with 2-5 people. If you have a learning group larger than this, consider breaking it down into sub-groups for discussions. 
- Leadership. Sometimes it works with one person taking leadership duties‚Äîlogistics, ‚Äúassignments,‚Äù etc‚Äîand sometimes it makes sense to jump between people. We only recommend asserting something, so that it isn‚Äôt aimless. You can re-structure later if need-be. 
- Goals. Is your group working towards a finite end (such as a date in time, the end of a book, or perhaps a publication)? Is it ongoing, and, if so, what are you trying to do in that timeline? Framing the direction of the group can help motivate people and get them excited about group activity.
