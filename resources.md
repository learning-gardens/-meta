# Resources

This document exists to help find topics, find information, structure information, teach effectively, learn effectively, run a group, be friendly, and achieve enlightenment üå±.

## What Can My Group Do?

Whatever you want. We recommend looking at our [examples](https://github.com/learning-gardens/__meta/blob/master/examples.md) document to help get a sense of the universe of ways you can organize a learning group!

Want to develop your illustration? Dedicate some group time to it, maybe include critiques. 

Want to read a difficult book? Find a couple partners and tackle it, maybe with some reading guides and external conversations. 

Want to learn how to garden? Find some friends who do, too, and get in touch with local resources‚Äîbotanists, libraries, gardens. 

Want to get a landscape of postcolonial theory? As usual, find some friends, figure out a method of approach, and get some weekly meet-ups going! Perhaps a local writer or professor is interested in talking and sharing. 

## How Should We Teach?

There is no right way to teach. It‚Äôs all context-dependent. Who are the students? Who are the teachers? What is the space, the time, the topic? Stay sensitive to these things. 

That said, we can pretty comfortably say that people learn well when they are pushed into unknown areas but with a good foundation and confidence, so as to enable [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Learners should be both encouraged and challenged. 

Their environment should empower whatever type of learning is necessary: if learning through reading, perhaps a quiet, reflective space. If learning through spatial exploration, perhaps field trips make the most sense! 

It‚Äôs usually not necessary to memorize things when you understand them. 

The best time to learn about something is typically just when you need it. After that, [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) helps.

Multimodality is important for various learners: don‚Äôt just read! Read, talk, look, experiment, play, touch, listen, smell, etc. Field trips are great, even if just an excuse to go somewhere with people.

## How Should We Structure Our Group?

We don‚Äôt intend to tell you exactly how to do your group. Every one can (and probably should) be different, responding to the people, the context, the material, and other factors. 

But, we can make some large claims for effective learning! We espouse:

- __Regularity__. Without regularity groups can easily lose momentum or focus. We recommend seeking a regular time and place if possible, and meeting at least once a month.
- __Manage group size__. Most conversations happen best with 2-5 people. If you have a learning group larger than this, consider breaking it down into sub-groups for discussions. 
- __Leadership__. Sometimes it works with one person taking leadership duties‚Äîlogistics, ‚Äúassignments,‚Äù etc‚Äîand sometimes it makes sense to jump between people. We only recommend asserting something, so that it isn‚Äôt aimless. You can re-structure later if need-be. 
- __Goals__. Is your group working towards a finite end (such as a date in time, the end of a book, or perhaps a publication)? Is it ongoing, and, if so, what are you trying to do in that timeline? Framing the direction of the group can help motivate people and get them excited about group activity. 
- __Flexibility__. If someone wants something very serious and intense, they‚Äôll probably register for a program somewhere. Do your thing, keep it fun, we‚Äôre all going to die anyway. 

## Where Can We Find Resources and Information?

The vast and varied topography of the internet offers much. Two potential starting places:

- [Free Databases & Libraries](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/free-databases-libraries)
- [Online course platforms (e.g. ‚ÄúMOOCs‚Äù) and Courses](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/online-learning-courses)

This doesn‚Äôt mean, however, that you shouldn‚Äôt work locally! Exploring local offerings is an amazing way to explore your area and meet people. Think about potential centers nearby‚Ä¶

- Libraries & Bookstores
- Community Organizations
- Art Spaces
- Archives & Museums
- Colleges & Universities (or a friend with academic journal access!)
- Makerspaces
- ‚Ä¶and more!

## How Should We Structure Our Materials? 

This is one of the most complex and interesting parts of teaching. How do you teach something? In what order should the concepts be presented? Where should we start, where should we end? This is the craft of making a syllabus.

For open-ended groups, this can often emerge dynamically as people respond to their interests. 

For finite groups, doing some up-front work of making a timeline for navigating content is more crucial. 

In short, I don‚Äôt know how you should structure your materials. It depends on the knowledge of your students coming in, potential goals you want to reach‚Äîsome set of knowledge? a publication? an event?‚Äîand what disciplines you want to explore or subvert. 

A good starting place is to see how other people have done it! Googling around for syllabi often yields results, and there are also two resources:

- [Syllabus Archive](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/syllabus-archive) on are.na.
- [The Open Syllabus Project](http://opensyllabusproject.org/)
