Lukas & Édouard

Pamphlet (work in Figma & Illustrator)
- LG is going to have two slips, one in the front, one after all of the group slips.
- First will have “what we are & do”
- End will have more of a manifesto / call-to-action, and how to get involved

We’re expecting pages from:
- PPL
- Pixel-Lab
- APL reading group
- Cybernetics
- Mornings
- …?
- (Studio Studio?)
- (Utopia School?)
- (Enrol Yourself?)
- (Evening Class?)

Launch Kickstarter this week.
Lo-fi video ala verygoods. Ed in charge of directorial decisions.

Lukas will write pamphlet copy & the rest of the Kickstarter

Tiers… 
decision to move LG sweaters to post-Kickstarter. Big pain in dealing with sizes and stuff.
We’ll just do stickers, pamphlet, totes. 

“Benefactor Bookmark” slip

“Desk Residency”… can we fund our own residency? To support ourselves working on this project? Crowdsourced patronage model.

NEEDS MORE THOUGHT: “Probation Period” for groups.
Two touchpoints:
	1. Launch
	2. One-month (?) check-in

What do we look for at each of these moments? Needs to be a bidirectional conversation.
