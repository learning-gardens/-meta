Present: Ed, Lukas, Kai

* Kai is working on Agnes, a tool to help sift through volume of events & groups to join in busy places (e.g. large cities, college campuses)

Might be used to cohere calendar of LG events or suggest groups to join.

Feature Suggestions:

Suggest possible speculative classes based on conversations happening within slack

Cross-pollinate slack channels, extract cool facts or data points that might make sense within the context of another group

Suggest events happening with other groups that might be interesting to people in another group

Coordinating with other LG-esque groups other than .edu-type communities?
- Launching in 5 uni. communities
    - can crawl entire club and student org websites
    - Title, image, logo,keywords, descrptions, etc.

Working towards integration with UN communities
