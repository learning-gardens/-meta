Onboarding Process…
We want people to ask “why am I joining?” AND know how to implement that. Too many joining without an idea in mind of how to participate—we need to better articulate. 

1. Change Landing-pad to announcements
2. Make a new landing-pad that is leavable. Slackbot will ping this once daily with intro text
3. Try to push people to ask “why am I here?”

Time to get back in touch with parallel orgs. Evening Class, Utopia School, Enrol Yourself, and more…

bi-weekly roundup of garden activity and links and such re: [Wild Times](http://amardeeps.com/wildtimes/)
Bi-weekly roundup can also serve as a moment of maintenance—announce new gardens, check in with existing ones, begin/end probation periods, approve grants, etc.
