##### 2017.1.5 — Enroll Yourself
###### Interview

- - -

##### Enroll Yourself

- Arose out of dissatisfaction with organizational growth
- Opportunity for gfxdesigners to do ‘weirder’ more different work
- Tasks:
	- Each member has own specialization, own project, spanning multiple disciplines
	- Felt intuitively that a diverse, divergent group was better — felt this was better compared to a Master’s program, where converging was the norm

##### 2017

- finishing the current (first) program
- starting another in May as current one ends
- each person could possibly do a workshop

- E: Any edits to the program in its next iteration?
	- first version was designed as it went along
	- every other sunday is “get shit done” sunday
	- it would be nice to make the program more modular, piecemeal to fit around people’s work/life lives
- L: Will Zahra be a participant in next Season?
	- The program might need it, since it’s good to experience what the program is like as it’s being formed
	- Potentially groups can have an ‘admin’-like figure, to manage meta aspects of the program
