Discussion has manifested two chief goals:
1. Establish plurality of discussion platforms
2. Nourish culture of gardens working towards something // "activating"

These are intertwined problems, but finishing the first will only help the second a bit. 

Twist vs Spectrum ? Not yet sure. Try to use both this week and final call next weekend.
