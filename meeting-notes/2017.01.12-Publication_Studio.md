Lukas + Antonia Pinter of [Publication Studio](http://www.publicationstudio.biz/) meeting in Los Angeles

~

Publication Studio:
- Started in Portland
- Does both publishing and services (printing, distribution, binding, etc)
- Grew organically. People would branch off or via residencies & start studios elsewhere.
- Every studio is autonomous & financially independent, but they can share resources, people, and projects. 
- Portland office now closing; Hudson to take the helm
- Online store run out of HQ

LG Pamphlet:
- The structure we wan’t isn’t really bindable unless we do a perfect binding, and that should start at a minimum of ~40 pages to be secure. 
- So maybe we roll with thicker paper & just let it all float! 
- Final dimensions will obvi be smaller than 8.5x11 if we want full bleed
- Consider something around it — rubber band? string? 
- Paper Options:
	- Either hit a Kelly Paper store or just use whatever connections your printer has
	- Neenah, Springhill, Domtar all good, color & weight options
	- Definitely use 24+ lb weight
- cc [Ooga Booga List](http://printers.oogaboogastore.com/tagged/Region%3A%20US%20West%20Coast)
	- If we creep up to SF, friends with Colpa Press

In short: Choose a printer, go there, describe to them, get a dummy. Cross-check, then print. Some good low-budget LA ones, for higher-service, [Typecraft](http://typecraft.co/) in Pasadena.
