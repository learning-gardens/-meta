Present: Lukas, Ed, 4 from Evening-Class.org (Nicole, Chya, ____, ____?)

- EC as response to contextual situation—location (London), tough economic times, impenetrable education system, etc
- 2 People started it in January 2016
- Started inviting people
- low formality
- centered around graphic design, now has artists/designers more broadly…
- Two meetings per week (Tues/Thurs evenings, no more than 3 hours). The idea was originally one-half theory, one-half practice. 
- “Curatorial Groups” are smaller chunks of the ~22ppl whole who organize content & logistics for ~2month spans
- £30 monthly fee goes towards rent of shared studio space, as well as paying nominal (£50) honorarium to speakers
- Nomadic meetings were difficult—shared, dedicated space made it easier for people to rally together and travel.
- people now in the space all day—collaborative work space
- Organizational structure very flat
- growth has been very organic. goals are vague but “neverending learning” and “supporting life”—respecting other commitments in others’ lives—is valued. 
- EC now acts as a community & support structure for this creative class in London—“fight the loneliness of London”
- Used spreadsheet of member interests, then voting, to split people into collaboration groups
- Now, members’ lives and EC space/group are starting to blend…
- Tried some Slack and Trello use—now Telegram (?)
- They have a desire to share more their resources/documentation and process of growth
- occasional practical skill share


- teaching classes in other people’s spaces
- model of schooling as reflection of global economic state
- in the beginning they thought 12 people was enough (for an application process), but we ended up accepting anyone
- application process, 1 person thinks of a person to invite, 2 people think of a person to invite, and so on
- initially the applications were graphic-design contextual, but they allowed many other ‘types’ of people to join
- meet twice a week, the same group
- half of class dedicated to theory, half to practice
- 22 people or so, always fluctuating

-

there’s no particular goal

never stop learning
