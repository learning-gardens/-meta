Meeting Notes

Enrol Yourself
- figure out how to communicate LG’s value alongside EY
    - is LG something that people can offboard onto?

Github Learning Curve Woes
- if we want the public to be editing notes, github is a high barrier of entry
- maybe it exists there for people who want/need to use it
- Google Documents might be a good alternative (for Spaces, Resources, etc.)

Slack Structure
- default ‘landing channel’

Self Publishing
- Get started back on this project
- Chat to Instagram Magazine
- Find bookstores interested in disseminating our pamphlets
    - Ooga Boogl
    - Farewell Books
    - etc.
- Determine printing costs
    - start a kickstarter?
    - figure out a way to fund after approximating costs

TODO
— port over ‘Critical Design Example Class’ from Github to Google Docs
— change the slack channel structure, make the default landing channel non-chat, display rules, etc.
