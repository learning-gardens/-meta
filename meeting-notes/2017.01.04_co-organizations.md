“Co-Organizational Growth” - what do we mean?
We see lots of small organizations working in similar modes. 
Can we lift each other up, collaborate in effective ways, and enact large-scale change without bogging ourselves down with bureaucracy? Stay nimble, bb

Should we structurally intertwine?
(probably not)

Public Science is ~40 people, only ~5 active though

Fei & Francis struck out as Public Science Agency to grow into full-time work. 

How much intentionality should we bring to a network of these groups? It is already emergent… collaboration might happen anyway… but important for us to STATE our interest in collaborating. 

Explicitly declaring a network. ARE WE A NEW WEBRING? 
“hydra projects”

Are.na & Slacks are substrate for the groups

What… are we all doing, though? 
Is it utopian? Is that word too exhausted?
