Biweekly Meeting - 02 October 2016
Lukas & Ed

Excitement over Francis & Ryan starting groups
Site is in final stages… last small things:
- make top header more prominent
- rework some copy ala Rachel’s advice

Lukas on copy editing duty

Shuffle between github and website is crucial.
Perhaps in a few months, website will really be the front-face. 

Pamphlet development - AASF is still a ways off (Nov 19-20). Touched base with Carol. 

Call with Utopia School tomorrow. Ed will do some outreach. 

Make sure everything is WELL-DOCUMENTED!

Ok, bye!
